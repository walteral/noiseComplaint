## 1. Complaint Map
From an application perspective, what scenario do you think is more appropriate to use a 2D web map (e.g., leaflet), and is more appropriate to use a 3D virtual globe?
  A good scenario that you would want to use a 3D map for would be when you want to compare something, particularly when what you are comparing is a difference in size. For example ![HERE](http://metrocosm.com/3d-world-population-globe/) is a 3D map of the globe showing populations in 2015. This is a good application because the different heights can immediately be interpreted.
  
A 2D map would be more appropriate when you are trying to display static themes, or a chloropleth map. Displaying a map where what is being displayed isn't enhanced by the 3D aspect of the data. For example a classic categorical map such as the [USGS geological survey] (https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/mapview/) wouldn't benefit from being in 3D.
